I'm Olivia, a PhD student in Statistics at Massey University (Palmerston North, New Zealand). I am passionate about Systems Biology, mathematical modelling and the study of biological networks from a statistical and computational perspective. I am currently working on unravelling genotype-to-phenotype relationships from multi-omics data using causality inference methods, with a focus on polyploid organisms.

I enjoy creating visualisation of complex data in R using ggplot2 and associated packages. 

I'm also an avid reader, and I like to paint with watercolour.
